# Source this before running `agentcore deploy` or any uv-driven build:
#
#     source scripts/env.sh
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# This machine runs a Lumeus ZTNA agent that terminates and re-signs TLS. Tools
# that use the OS trust store (npm, brew, curl) work because the agent's root is
# installed there. `uv` is built on rustls and ships its OWN root store, so it
# rejects the re-signed certificate with "invalid peer certificate:
# UnknownIssuer" and every AgentCore CDK synth fails while resolving Python
# dependencies.
#
# The fix is to hand uv a bundle containing both the public roots (certifi) and
# the Lumeus root, via SSL_CERT_FILE. The bundle is generated locally and is
# gitignored, because it is specific to this machine's security agent.
#
# Deliberately POSIX-ish: this gets sourced from zsh (the default macOS shell)
# as often as from bash, so it must not rely on BASH_SOURCE, and it must not
# `set -e`/`set -u`, which would leak into the caller's interactive shell.
